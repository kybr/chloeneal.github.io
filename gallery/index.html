    <h1> Dysfunctional Jewelry Box </h1>
    <h4> by Chloe Neal </h4>
    <img src= "jewelry_box.jpg" width="600" />
    <p> Made out of 12 layers of lasercut 6mm plywood, and four layers of 3D-printed PLA, "Dysfunctional Jewelry Box" serves both an aesthetic and functional purpose. 
    Designed using Blender and Fusion360, while also making use of the softwares 3DPrinterOS and Adobe Illustrator, this piece took about 
    a week's worth of time to design and physically create. 
    The inspiration for it comes from the wavy designs in furniture that have recently been resurfacing + the urge to create something 
    that had an illusion-like effect to it.

    <h1> Press Fit Box </h1>
    <h4>by Chloe Neal</h4>
    <img src= "pressfitbox2.jpg" width="600" />
    <p> Lasercut with 6mm plywood, these pieces snap together to form a little box to hold other objects. The lid is the only non-press fit part of the box, but it can be 
    easily be put on, or taken off. The design on the lid is supposed to resemble a starfish and bubbles (designed especially for my mom :)).

    <h1> Color Chaos </h1>
    <h4>by Chloe Neal </h4>
    <img src= "designprinciples_fp.jpg" width="600" />
    <p> Made with a sketching website, I drew colorful designs layered on top of one another by manipulating color, negative and positive space, and making use of 
      repeating shapes. Each of the six designs were created separately, and then combined together. One of the rules I worked with on this sketch were that each fragment of the
      design had to be built on top of the other; once I finished the second fragment of the design, I couldn't go back and change the first.
